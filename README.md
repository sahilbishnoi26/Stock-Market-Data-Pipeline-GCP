# Stock Market Data Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a stock market data pipeline using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The pipeline is designed to handle both real-time and batch data, process large volumes of stock market data, and integrate machine learning models for better insights. The key GCP services used in this project enable scalable and efficient data engineering workflows.

## Architecture
We will leverage the following GCP services to build our stock market data pipeline:

### **Real-time Data Ingestion and Processing**
1. **Pub/Sub** - A messaging service for asynchronous communication, enabling real-time data streaming from stock market APIs.
2. **Dataflow** - A fully managed data processing service that uses Apache Beam to process real-time data streams.

### **Batch Data Ingestion and Processing**
1. **Cloud Storage** - An object storage service to store batch data such as news and other relevant datasets.
2. **Dataproc** - A managed service that runs Apache Spark jobs to process large-scale batch data efficiently.

### **Data Warehousing and Analytics**
1. **BigQuery** - A serverless data warehouse to store and analyze processed data using SQL queries. Supports both real-time and batch data ingestion.
2. **Looker** - A business intelligence tool for data visualization and dashboard creation.

### **Machine Learning Integration**
1. **Vertex AI** - A managed machine learning platform where data scientists can build, train, and deploy ML models.

### **Additional GCP Services**
- **Cloud SQL** - Managed relational database service supporting PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- **Datastore & Bigtable** - NoSQL databases for different data storage needs.
- **Cloud Composer** - A managed Apache Airflow service for workflow orchestration.
- **Cloud Functions** - An event-driven compute service for serverless execution.
- **Compute Engine** - Virtual machines for custom compute needs.
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** - Networking services to securely connect cloud resources.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** - Access control and security management.
- **Stackdriver** - Logging and monitoring for cloud applications.

## Workflow
1. **Real-time Stock Data Processing**
   - Stock data is fetched from an API and published to **Pub/Sub**.
   - **Dataflow** processes the streamed data in real-time.
   - Processed data is stored in **BigQuery** for analytics.

2. **Batch Data Processing**
   - News data and other batch sources are stored in **Cloud Storage**.
   - **Dataproc** runs Apache Spark jobs to process batch data.
   - Processed batch data is stored in **BigQuery**.

3. **Data Analytics and Visualization**
   - Analysts use **BigQuery** for SQL-based data analysis.
   - **Looker** is used to create dashboards and visualize trends.

4. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Processed data is used to train models in **Vertex AI**.
   - Trained models help generate insights and forecasts.

## How to Get Started
1. **Set Up GCP Services:** Ensure you have a GCP account and necessary permissions.
2. **Enable Required APIs:** Activate Pub/Sub, Dataflow, BigQuery, and other relevant services.
3. **Ingest Real-time Data:** Stream stock data into Pub/Sub.
4. **Process Data:** Use Dataflow for real-time processing and Dataproc for batch processing.
5. **Store and Analyze:** Store processed data in BigQuery and analyze using SQL.
6. **Build Dashboards:** Use Looker to create visual reports.
7. **Deploy ML Models:** Train and deploy models using Vertex AI.
